Partitioning
------------
Feliz will enable you to select which existing partitions you want to use for root, home, etc.

However, it cannot create new partitions for you, nor can it alter existing partitions. This means that, if you want to change an existing partition table, or create a new one, you will have to do that with some other software outside Feliz. One option is Gparted Live (https://gparted.org/download.php), or a similar partitioning program. As an alternative to Gparted, several command-line (cli) partitioning tools are included with the Arch Linux session:
   cfdisk
   fdisk
   parted 
   
If you create partitions using these cli tools, you will also have to format them with appropriate filesystems (perhaps using: mkfs.ext4 and similar commands). See the man pages or Arch Wiki for help.

After creating or changing your partitions, restart Feliz by typing ./feliz

The partitions you need for Arch Linux might be as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------
For a BIOS/MBR system ...
A root partition of at least 8GB (up to 15GB, depending on available space) - type ext4;
If desired, a swap partition up to 4GB - type linux-swap (or Feliz can make a swap file);
If desired, a home partition of 10GB or more (for all your programs, data, etc) - type ext4.

For a UEFI/GPT system â€¦
An EFI partition of 512MB to 1GB of type vfat;
A root partition of at least 8GB (up to 15GB, depending on available space) - type ext4;
If desired, a swap partition up to 4GB - type linux-swap (or Feliz can make a swap file);
If desired, a home partition of 10GB or more (for all your programs, data, etc) - type ext4.

If you do not desire a separate home partition, then your root partition should be 20GB or bigger.
