Partitioning
------------
Feliz used to offer tools to modify existing partitions and create new partitions.
However, there have recently been serious problems with this code, so those options
have been removed until the bugs can be fixed. This means that the partitions you
wish to use for installation must be created before running Feliz.

I recommend using Gparted Live (https://gparted.org/download.php), or a similar
partitioning program, to prepare the partition table in advance, in accordance with
the procedures set out in the Arch Wiki.

As an alternative to Gparted, several command-line (cli) partitioning tools are
included with the Arch Linux session:
   cfdisk
   fdisk
   parted
If you create partitions using the above cli tools, you will also have to format
them with appropriate filesystems, using the same tools. See the man pages for help.

After setting up your partitions (see suggestions below) restart Feliz by typing:
   ./feliz.sh

If Feliz still informs you that there are no partitions, try shutting down the
session and restarting. If that fails, then Gparted may be your best bet.

The partitions you need for Arch Linux might be as follows:

For a BIOS/MBR system ...
A root partition of at least 8GB (up to 15GB, depending on available space) - type ext4;
If desired, a swap partition up to 4GB - type linux-swap (or Feliz can make a swap file);
If desired, a home partition of 10GB or more (for all your programs, data, etc) - type ext4.

For a UEFI/GPT system â€¦
An EFI partition of 512MB to 1GB of type vfat;
A root partition of at least 8GB (up to 15GB, depending on available space) - type ext4;
If desired, a swap partition up to 4GB - type linux-swap (or Feliz can make a swap file);
If desired, a home partition of 10GB or more (for all your programs, data, etc) - type ext4.

If you do not desire a separate home partition, then your root partition should be 20GB or bigger.
