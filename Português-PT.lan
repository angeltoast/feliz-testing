Notes to translators (turn Line-numbers on in your text editor)
--------------------
1) Please translate line #1 to say the translation language;
2) Please translate line #2 to say your name and email address;
   (it is your work and you deserve to be recognised for it)
3) Translations start at line #19
4) Please translate all lines at exactly the same line number,
    and do not add or delete any lines (this is very important)
5) If any translated line will be over 70 characters, please re-phrase to make it shorter
6) Save your file as <Language>.lan
   (where <Language> is the native name of the language - for example: Espa√±ol.lan)
7) If you have any questions or problems, please email or contact me through Facebook
