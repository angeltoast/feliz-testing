This is the 'testing' repo for the Feliz Arch Linux installation scripts.

The scripts in this repo will most likely be unstable at various times and should not be used for anything other than testing. They are shared in the spirit of the community, subject to the conditions set out in the GNU GENERAL LICENSE.

Feliz is a progression from the Achoo scripts, adding the option of a semi-graphical environment. Feliz and Achoo aim to speed up and simplify the installation of Arch Linux for experienced or new users.
