This is the 'testing' repo for the Feliz Arch Linux installation scripts. The scripts in this repo will most likely be unstable at various times and should not be used for anything other than testing. They are shared in the spirit of the community, subject to the conditions set out in the GNU GENERAL LICENSE.

Feliz is a progression from the Achoo scripts, adding the option of a semi-graphical environment. Feliz and Achoo aim to speed up and simplify the installation of Arch Linux for experienced or new users.


This is Feliz2, which builds on the best of the original Achoo and Feliz command-line style display. Feliz2 does not have the semi-graphical display option. It is proudly cli - fast and easy-to-use, with helpful onscreen advice at every stage. During installation, all output is displayed on the screen, so that the user can see exactly what the installer is doing.
