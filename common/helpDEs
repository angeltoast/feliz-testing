These are the most trusted desktop environments from the Arch
Linux repositories. You can add as many as desired, but be aware
that they do not all play nicely together. Gnome and KDE, for
instance, both install their own greeter (display manager), and
only one display manager can be active for any installation.

As you add each DE, you may be prompted to choose a display manager
(where one is optional) or to ask if you want additional packages
available for that particular DE.
