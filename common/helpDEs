These are the most trusted desktop environments from the Arch Linux repositories. You can add as many as desired, but be aware that they do not all play nicely together. Gnome and KDE, for instance, both install their own display manager, and only one display manager can be active for any installation.

If you are undecided, check out their websites:

Cinnamon - aesthetically pleasing - developed by the Linux Mint team: https://linuxmint.com/

Deepin Desktop Environment is the DE created for the Deepin distro: https://www.deepin.org/

GNOME is composed entirely of free and open-source software: https://www.gnome.org/

KDE Plasma5 - graphical DE and range of applications: https://www.kde.org/

LXDE - full-featured DE with low resource requirements: http://lxde.org/

LXQt - the Qt port of LXDE, the Lightweight Desktop Environment: http://lxqt.org/

MATE - the DE by the Linux Mint team - a continuation of GNOME 2: http://mate-desktop.org/

Xfce - a lightweight DE that is fast and low on system resources: http://www.xfce.org/

As you add each DE, you may be prompted to choose a display manager (where one is optional) or to ask if you want additional packages available for that particular DE.
