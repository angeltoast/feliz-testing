Locale defines the user's language and country. It is used to set fonts and system language, and to find the best mirrors for downloading your system.

The first two characters (in lower case) represent the language, and the next two characters (in UPPER CASE) represent the country.
  Example: en_GB represents English in Great Britain;
  Example: es_AR represents Spanish in Argentina.
  
You can choose only one option.

The list is sorted alphabetically. Scroll up or down using the arrow keys, or type the first character to find your choice. When your choice is highlighted, select <Ok> and press [Enter]

Pressing [Esc] will exit, but may result in errors later if no item is selected.
