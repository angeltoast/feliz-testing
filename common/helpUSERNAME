Every linux system has a root user, who has God-like
administrative powers over the system. However, even on
a single-user system, it is not wise to do everything
as root. For this reason, you will normally want to set
up at least one user, and this person will be given a
unique user name by which they will be recognised.

Often, usernames are variations on the user's name, such
as jsmith for John Smith. User account names can be
anything from the user's name, initials, or birthplace
to something more creative. You can use almost anything,
but there are some reserved words which must not be used,
including: root, www, admin, 

User names must be a single word containing only lower-case
letters and the numbers 0 to 9, with no spaces.
