A hostname is a unique name created to identify a machine
on a network. You can use almost anything - it could be
your domain name, for instance - but you shouldnâ€™t use
the same hostname on two different computers on a network,
as this can cause problems, and there are some reserved
words which must not be used, including: root, www, admin

Host names can only contain alpha characters ( a to z ),
numbers ( 0 to 9 ) plus hyphen ( - ) and/or period ( . )
No spaces. Letters are case insensitive. A hostname must
begin and end with a letter or number, not a hyphen or
period, and must be between 2 and 63 characters.
