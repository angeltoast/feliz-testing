If your computer is low on RAM, it is possible for it to use part of your hard disk as temporary storage. You can allocate a fixed part of your hard disk for this purpose. This combination of RAM and swap files is known as virtual memory. The general guide is to allocate a swap space of the same size as your RAM, up to a maximum of 8GB - if you have more than 8GB of RAM, you are unlikely to benefit much from a swap partition.

If you need swap, but are limited in available disk space, consider nominating a swap file of up to (say) 2GB. Your system will then create temporary a swap files as required on any available space on your hard disk.
