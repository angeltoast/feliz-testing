You may need a swap partition if your computer is low on RAM.
The system will then use the swap partition for temporary
storage. The general guide is to allocate a swap of the same
size as your RAM, up to a maximum of 8GB - if you have more
than 8GB of RAM, you are unlikely to benefit from a swap
partition. If you need swap, but are limited in available
disk space, consider a swap file of up to (say) 2GB
