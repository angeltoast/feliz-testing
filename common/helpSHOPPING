Here you can choose from optional extra programs from the
Arch Linux repositories. Browse through the lists, selecting
any you want to add, one at a time. Your selections
will be listed at the top of the window. You can add as many
as desired, in almost any combination, and you can return to
any category to add anything you forgot.

In case you change your mind, if you select an item already
on your list, you will be asked if you wish to delete it.

Select <Done> when you have finished shopping.
