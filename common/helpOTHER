Sometimes partitioning is used as a means of logically separating data. This may be for general use, such as a /home partition, or for specific data, such as for audio and video files. 

You have more partitions on your system than have been assigned to be used as your essential root or swap, and now you can choose whether you wish to use them for this installation or not. It may be that they belong to another installation, Windows, perhaps, or another Linux system - in that case, close this help window and select <Done>.

If there are partitions available, you may wish to assign one as /home - it is not essential to have a /home partition, but some
people believe it adds a level of safety and convenience for their work files and other data in the event of reinstalling the operating system.

The slash ( / ) before the name (eg: /home ) indicates that this partition is to be recognised as a 'mountpoint', an accessible filesystem on which a hierarchy of directories may be organized.

Mountpoints must be a single word, lower-case letters only. It is not recommended to create too many mountpoints.
