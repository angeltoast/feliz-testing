Although the Ext2 filesystem is still available for legacy
purposes, it differs from the others in that it is not a
'journaling' system. Modern Linux filesystems are journaling
file systems. These are more reliable when it comes to data
storage. A journaling file system first writes data to another
part of the hard drive and notes the necessary changes to a
log, then in the background it goes through each entry to the
journal and begins to complete the task, and when the task is
complete, it checks it off on the list. Thus the file system
is always in a consistent state and can be recovered in the
event of a crash.

Note: 'Ext' refers to 'extended' - meaning that the system has
       more capabilities than earlier filesystems

The oldest journaling filesystem in Linux is Ext3.

Unless you have a special requirement or preference, you may
as well choose Ext4
