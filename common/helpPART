Partitioning a hard drive divides the available space into sections that can be accessed independently.

An entire hard drive may be allocated to a single partition, or may be divided across multiple partitions. This may be required for dual- or multi- booting, for example, or for maintaining a swap partition. You may need a swap partition if your computer is low on RAM - the system will then use the swap partition for temporary storage. In other cases, partitioning is used as a means of logically separating data, such as creating separate partitions for audio and video files. 

Even if you create no other partitions, you must create at least one, for root (/). The root partition may be between 8G and 20G, depending on the available disk space.

It is not essential to have more than one partition - you can run your entire system perfectly well from a single partition, as long as it is big enough to hold all the programs you use.

There are 3 types of partitions:
    Primary
    Extended
     Logical

Primary partitions can be bootable and are limited to four partitions per disk or RAID volume.

If a partitioning scheme requires more than four partitions, an extended partition containing logical partitions can be used. Extended partitions can be thought of as containers for logical partitions. A hard disk can contain no more than one extended partition. The extended partition is also counted as a primary partition so if the disk has an extended partition, only three additional primary partitions are possible ...
 i.e. three primary partitions and one extended partition.
 
The number of logical partitions residing in an extended partition is unlimited. A system that dual boots with Windows will require that Windows reside in a primary partition.
