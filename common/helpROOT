root (/)

The root partition will contain Linux and everything that you install
with Linux. Even if you create no other partitions, you must create a
partition for root.

The size of your root partition will vary depending on what you plan
to install. In general, you should be fine with a root partition of
about 8GB to 10GB for Arch Linux, but if you have enough disk space, it is
not a bad idea to allow more - up to 20G should be plenty. If you have
a small hard drive, you can use as little as 6G, but you will be
restricted in how much you can install later.
