A display manager, or login manager, is typically a graphical
user interface that is displayed at the end of the boot process. 

A display manager presents the user with a login screen, into 
which a user enters a combination of username and password to
gain access to the desktop.

Only one display manager can be active for any installation.

Gnome and KDE both install their own display manager, but
most other DEs allow you to choose. If in doubt, LightDM is
widely used.
