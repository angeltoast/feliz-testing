The Feliz scripts work with you to produce a fast installation of Arch Linux. They are shared in the spirit of the community, subject to the conditions set out in the GNU GENERAL LICENSE.

Feliz is a progression from the Achoo scripts, created to speed up an installation of Arch Linux, plus a 'shopping list' of extras like desktop environments, web browsers, office software and programming tools. Feliz is always up-to-date, as each time you run Feliz it downloads the latest version of the scripts from Github. Then an initialising phase helps you to enter such essential data as your location, username, etc, and works with you to set up your partitioning, then the script runs without further intervention to the end.

Burn the iso to a CD or USB stick, or run it directly in Virtualbox. It starts a live session of Arch Linux, and runs the script. All you have to do is follow the prompts. Installation follows closely the Arch Wiki beginners' guide, and hopefully you will understand something of the process by the time it has finished; you may even like to try a manual installation with the help of the Wiki.
